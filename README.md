## Inspiration
Our team is composed of second year students and looking back on our first year and thinking of our transition into university, we decided to create an app that compiles all of the resources—and some of our own—that we found to be useful for first year engineering students at the University of Alberta in a convenient manner.

## What it does
**CLASS COMPASS**
- Navigate the campus efficiently by identifying the quickest routes to their classes. 
- Search the abbreviation of the building 

**SYLLABUS SIMPLIFIER**
- Simplify course syllabi by highlighting the key topics, making it easier for users to quickly understand the most important information 
- Upload a pdf of their class syllabus, and the “Simplified Syllabus” Google Sheets will automatically be updated in a few minutes with just the key details of the syllabus through the power of machine learning!

**VIDEO VAULT**
- Filters YouTube videos tailored to engineering courses and specific topics 
- Easily search for relevant materials previous students found useful to support their learning and engineering journey

**PROF POLL**
- Access insights and experiences from former students regarding the professors for each of their first-year engineering courses 
- Streamline selecting a professor whose teaching style aligns with their personal learning preferences

**NETWORK NEXUS**
- Effortlessly expand your connections with Network Nexus. 
- Seamless searching of names directly on LinkedIn, allowing users to quickly find and connect with others. Perfect for networking on the go!

**CAMPUS CRUSH**
- Note down individuals that catch your eye
- Keep track of important details

## How we built it
- To conveniently view how our html, css, and js code displayed, we used CodePen 
- We combined our own resources with existing resources 
- We used openAI API to parse through the syllabus text and extract it to a Google Sheet

## Challenges we ran into
- We do want it to be both desktop and mobile friendly but with the time constraints, we mainly kept it mobile friendly 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Self learned multiple software and coding practices through resources such as Youtube and Stack Overflow
- Collaborated to exchange insights and troubleshoot technical challenges, drawing from personal experience and diverse perspectives to brainstorm effective, user-centered solutions
- Developed an intelligent syllabus parsing feature using OpenAI's machine learning algorithm to streamline key content extraction in the Syllabus Simplifier
- Designed an intuitive and easy to navigate UI, ensuring a smooth and easy experience for any student!

## What we learned
- We learned how effective planning and having systems is in developing a project
- How to integrate and work with APIs to expand our app’s capabilities
- Learned how to create automated workflows through Zapier, enabling effective synchronization between APIs
- How to self learn unfamiliar programs and coding languages (e.g. HTML, JavaScript, CSS)
- The difference between front end development and backend development
- We learned that we enjoy web development! 

## What's next for Studious Start
- Creating an app for easier convenience
- Creating a forum where the status of the washrooms can be updated by users
